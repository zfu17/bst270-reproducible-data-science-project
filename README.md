# BST270: Individual project

This is my repository for the 2025 Winter BST270 individual project.

## Porject structure

We made an attempt to reproduce the following:

* A table from [Where Are America's Librarians](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-are-americas-librarians/https:/), [GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/librarians)
* The first graph from [The Dallas Shooting Was Among The Deadliest For Police In U.S. History](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dallas-shooting-was-among-the-deadliest-for-police-in-u-s-history/), [GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/police-deaths)

## Data

The cleaned data tables are being stored in the [Data](Data) directory in this repo.

## How to get started

1. Clone this GitHub repo.
2. Open the [`analysis.Rmd`](analysis.Rmd) file in R Studio. Check dependencies as described in the Rmd file.
3. Click `Knit` to generate the output html file. This file has also been uploaded [here](analysis.html).
