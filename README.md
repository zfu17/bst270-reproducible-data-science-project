# BST270: Individual project

This is my repository for the 2025 Winter BST270 individual project.

## Porject structure

We made an attempt to reproduce the following:

* A table from [Where Are America's Librarians](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-are-americas-librarians/https:/), [GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/librarians)
* A graph from [The Dallas Shooting Was Among The Deadliest For Police In U.S. History](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dallas-shooting-was-among-the-deadliest-for-police-in-u-s-history/https:/), [GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/police-deathshttps:/)

## Data

The cleaned data tables are being stored in the [Data](Data) directory in this repo.

## How to get started
